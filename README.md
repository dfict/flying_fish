# flying_fish

Welcome.  This is the repository containing code and OSH files for the solar sounder known as Flying Fish. It's a solar-powered, temperature and light controlled board. you can buy the circuit board, soon, at <a href"https://monadmonad.square.site/">my ghost company, Monad</a>. It also will work on vanilla Arduino UNO but you'll need to provide peripherals such as temp sensor, amp, etc.
